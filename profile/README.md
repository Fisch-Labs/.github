# Fisch-Labs

We’re a small team building from first principles — starting with FishDB, a graph database written in C++ with native versioning baked in.

We believe future infrastructure will be:
- Graph-native
- Version-aware
- LLM-compatible by design

This is not another wrapper around old ideas. We’re here to build from scratch — fast, lean, and ready for the next decade of data.

### Projects
- **[FishDB](https://github.com/Fisch-Labs/FishDB)** – A versioned graph database engine, built for RAG, explainability, and weird experiments

### Not in it for the stars. In it for the system design.
