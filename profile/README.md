# 🐟 Fisch-Labs

We're building cool, weird, and fast stuff with graphs.

### 🚧 In the lab:
- 🧠 FishDB – a versioned graph database engine in C++
- 🤖 Graph-native infra for RAG, LLMs, and anything semi-intelligent
- 🧪 Systems + AI + vibes

---

### 📍 Who we are:
A small group of engineers who think infrastructure should be smarter, not heavier.

📦 Experimental.  
⚡ Fast.  
😈 Slightly unhinged.

> Stay weird. Ship fast.

🐡 Made with love in the deep sea.
