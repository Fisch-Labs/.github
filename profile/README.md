# Fisch-Labs

We’re a small team building from first principles — starting with FishDB, a graph database written in C++ with native versioning baked in.

We believe future infrastructure will be:
- Graph-native
- Version-aware
- LLM-compatible by design

### Projects
- **[FishDB](https://github.com/Fisch-Labs/FishDB)** – A versioned graph database engine, built for RAG, explainability, and weird experiments
